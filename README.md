# BackPress WordBone

This repository serves to hold my ongoing experiments in building applications with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) on top of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org).

Let me stress: *experiments*. If you're looking for best practices, please stop, go back to the last intersection, and take the other road.

## Projects in this repository

1. [TodoMVC Theme](TodoMVC)
  * The [Backbone.js](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/) example from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com), re-envisioned as a WordPress theme
2. [TwentyFuture Theme](TwentyFuture)
  * The [Twenty Twelve](http://twentytwelvedemo.wordpress.com/) default theme, abused to render its post content using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) views.
3. [PostListr](PostListr)
  * A small, standalone Backbone app, which will list out the last 10 entries in a WordPress.com or Jetpack JSON API-enabled blog.
