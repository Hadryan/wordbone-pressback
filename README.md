# WordBone PressBack

This repository serves to hold my ongoing experiments in building applications with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) on top of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org).

Let me stress: *experiments*. These are not necessarily proven best practices. If you're interested in figuring this out with us, read on!

## Projects in this repository

1. [Step By Step from WordPress & jQuery to WordPress & Backbone](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wcchi-demo#readme)
  * A repository demonstrating how to refactor a jQuery theme component to leverage Backbone.js for structure and eventing
2. [TodoMVC Theme](TodoMVC)
  * The [Backbone.js example](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/) from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com), re-envisioned as a WordPress theme
3. [TwentyFuture Theme](TwentyFuture)
  * The [Twenty Twelve](http://twentytwelvedemo.wordpress.com/) default theme, abused to render its post content using Backbone views.
4. [PostListr](PostListr)
  * A small, standalone Backbone app, which will list out the last 10 entries in a WordPress.com or Jetpack JSON API-enabled blog.
