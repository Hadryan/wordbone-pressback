# PostListr

This small app will fetch a list of the latest 10 posts from any blog accessible through the [WordPress.com REST API](http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/) (including self-hosted blogs using [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) with the JSON API module enabled).

Since this app is completely standalone, depending on WordPress only for its data, you can run it directly from this repository's Github pages: [check it out here](http://kadamwhite.github.io/backpress-wordbone/)!
